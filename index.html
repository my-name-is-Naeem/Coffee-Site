        Coffee tastes better when it is <b>strong!<br />Do you agree?</b>

      <p class="mainP">
        The case for coffee is stronger than ever. Study after study indicates
        you could be getting more from your favorite morning beverage than you
        thought: Coffee is chock full of substances that may help guard against
        conditions more common in women, including Alzheimer’s disease and heart
        disease. Caffeine is the first thing that comes to mind when you think
        about coffee But coffee also contains antioxidants and other active
        substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against
        disease,say nutrition experts from Johns Hopkins University School of
        Medicine.

        Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee
        cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffee.
        There are a wide variety <br />of species of coffee plants, ranging from
        shrubs to trees.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Type of bean.</b>There are two main types of rot fee species,
          Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a
          mild, flavorful lasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
          However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is
          sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady
          temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee
          plant Is more economical to grow because It is resistant to disease
          and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees
          Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as
          variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted
          at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich
          aroma and flavor t associate with coffee. They are then cooled an
          ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to
          dark.Lighter the color and roasted flavor and
          the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little
          acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is
          medium dark
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type of grind</b>. A medium grind is the most common and used for
          automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors
          like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarsegrind is used in
          coffee presses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b> This is an option for those who
          experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common
          methods used to remove caffeine from toffee is to apply chemical
          solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas.
          Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to
          dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans
          are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 07%
          of the cat feine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so
          there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may
          cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in
          coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be
          destroyed during processing.

              Nescafé is a brand of coffee made by Nestlé. It comes in many
              different forms. The name is a portmanteau of the words "Nestlé"
              and "café".[3] Nestlé first introduced their flagship coffee brand
              in Switzerland on 1 April 1938.In the United Kingdom, a television
              advertisement campaign, the Gold Blend couple starring Anthony
              Head and Sharon Maughan ran in 12 instalments between 1987 and
              1993.[5] The first 11 episodes were released as a promotional
              compilation video called Love Over Gold in 1993.
